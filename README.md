# Cash-Management-and-Control

This project is still under development and will undergo some updates over time.
Feel free to use it as you see fit.
There are apps like this that are paid, and maybe some free, well, that this project serves as a learning experience.

# Features:
• A tab called ‘Login’, available to connect as a system manager, thus making some tabs more secure for use by administrators only.

• A tab called ‘New sale’, responsible for selling products. In it we select the customer, which products he wants, the quantity, the form of payment, and some observations if necessary. In this tab we are responsible for selling in general.

• A tab called ‘Products / Change Inventory’ for organization and total inventory control, applying cost price and etc.

• A tab called ‘Customer Registration’, to make it easier to control which customers are ordering.

• A tab called ‘Sales history’, identified by a pie chart to facilitate sales understanding and divided by: day, month and year.

• A tab called ‘Financial’, available to identify how much profit has come in, how much money has been spent and to be able to include and organize how much has been spent.

• A tab called ‘News / Warnings’, where an online system responsible for program updates and news will be implemented soon.

• A tab called ‘Settings’, directed to the system administrator. You can remove the sales history, reset the existing items, reset the program completely, apply a discount to a certain item, export the history in notepad and soon, import a database for the project.

This is the first version available of this application, I hope it helps as many people as possible.
Changes will be made soon and I will add them to the project (Without prior notice).
Feel free to modify and use the codes!

The project may have some errors, fix them and have fun.
You must also change the connection to the database.
